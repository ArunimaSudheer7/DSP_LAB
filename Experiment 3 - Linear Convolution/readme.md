## AIM

To find the linear convolution with and without using function. 

(a) Using Built-in function

(b) Without Using Built-in function

## THEORY

Linear convolution is a mathematical operation used to combine two signals to produce a third signal. 
It's a fundamental operation in signal processing and systems theory. 

Mathematical Definition: 

Given two signals, x(t) and h(t), their linear convolution is defined as: 
                          
                           y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = ∫𝐱(𝛕)𝐡(𝐭 − 𝛕) 𝐝𝛕 

Applications: 

• Filtering: Convolution is used to filter signals, removing unwanted frequencies or noise. 

• System Analysis: The impulse response of a system completely characterizes its behaviour, 
  and convolution can be used to determine the output of the system given a known input. 

• Image Processing: Convolution is used for tasks like edge detection, blurring, and sharpening 
  images.
